            <h2>Unleash Your Inner Beauty</h2>
            <p>Makeup isn't about hiding behind a "mask", it truly is about enhancing your natural beauty and learning
                to love the skin that you're in. From skincare to makeup application, I guide my clients to ultimately
                feel
                like the best version of themselves. Whether that version is through soft glam, a full beat face, or a
                creative FX look, I will
                work diligently to bring your ideal look to life. -G.E.

                <p>My name is Gabrielle Eula Rivera, and I'm a Certified Makeup Artist and Eyelash
                    Extension Technician. My makeup journey started when I was 15 years old.
                    Feeling uncomfortable in my own skin, ashamed of the acne and scars that remained,
                    I turned to makeup to feel beautiful and confident. After years of practicing and at
                    first self-teaching, I decided to take my craft more seriously. <br><br>Finally able to call
                    myself a certified artist, I am always learning to love myself - flaws and all - and
                    is what I strive to provide for my clients.

                    <p>Gabrielle was absolutely amazing. She is super sweet and warm and listens to any request you may
                        have. The creativity in her work is not only beautiful but one of a kind. Having my makeup done
                        by her was an amazing and relaxing experience. I have met many make up artists whom are not
                        sanitary which makes me nervous but Gabrielle is top of the line. You will never be
                        disappointed. I am will be a forever client!

                    <p>Gabby is amazing. She did a night makeup look for me and she is very organized with all her
                        makeup tools and makeup. But most importantly what caught my attention and that I loved the most
                        was how clean and sanitary her brushes were. All brushes she used in my face were pre washed and
                        some tools she opened from the package in my presence. She made the entire make up hour fun and
                        very relaxing and a learning environment.</p>

                    <p>First I just want to say that Iâ€™ve been wanting my Halloween make up done by her since last year
                        lol. Our overall experience with her was amazing. You can tell that every inch of our painting
                        was detailed. I would recommend her to anyone who needs make up done! Nothing but good vibes
                        with her. Thanks again </p>

                        about Gabby is that she is punctual, professional, and takes her time
