            <h2>Unleash Your Inner Beauty</h2>
            <p>My name is Gabrielle and I'm a Certified Makeup Artist and Eyelash Extension
                Technician. My makeup journey started when I was 15 years old. Feeling uncomfortable
                in my own skin, ashamed of the acne and scars that remained I turned to makeup to feel
                beautiful and confident. After years of practicing and at first self-teaching, I decided
                to take my craft more seriously. Finally able to call myself a certified artist, I am
                always learning to love myself, flaws and all and this is what I strive to provide for my clients.
